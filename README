Following things are to be done in order to make this updater work:

1. All the files including A3Client.exe, setup.ini etc. have to be kept in a browser accessible single folder in the web server.

2. Download HashMyFile software and generate md5 hash (its better to make it display only md5 hash by changing option) for the whole folder were you kept your update files. Then select all the results and save it as CSV file with name 'md5'. It will generate a md5.csv file.

3. Copy 'md5.csv' file to the folder where update files are kept.

4. Edit path.ini and replace the existing URL with your custom URL. For example if the files are present in a folder named 'Update' situated in the base path of localserver then the URL would be 'http://127.0.0.1/update/' (Do NOT forget to add '/' at the end)

5. Download 7zip software for windows and install it. Then inside the installed directory you will find 7zip.exe. Copy that file into your update folder.

6. Keep A3Updater.exe and path.ini in a single folder and run A3Updater.exe to update existing files or to make full download.

7. Distribute A3Updater.exe and path.ini to the players so that they will update their client.

8. If anything is not working be free to contact me at karthikreadnovel@gmail.com

9. Visual Studio 2008 or higher version is needed to build this code. Edit this code to your needs and use it for your server.
